# MinMax

Defines an abstract class that can be used to quickly implement a minmax algorithm to a game. The algorithm has an adaptative depth feature to control the time it takes to compute its next move.


## Game requirements


- Two player game.
- Describable by a list of player positions (and empty squares)

## How to implement
The GameAbstract class must be inherited from in a new specific class for the game. The following methods must be defined : 
- `get_free_space(self, board) -> list[int]` : Returns all the playable squares.
- `check_win(self, board) -> int` : Returns the number of the winner if there is one, otherwise 0.
- `place_for(self, player, place, board) -> bool` : Plays for the given player at the given place and returns True if the move was actually possible.
- `display(self)` : Displays the game.
- `choose_among(self, moves)` : Chooses the move to plays among a list of move considered all equal. May be a random function.

Some of those functions don't receive the `board` argument, it means the board that need to be considered is `self.board`.

## Heuristic

Currently, the heuristic for a given situation if : 
- 1 if the computer wins
- -1 if the player wins
- 0 otherwise

## Multiprocess

The programm makes use of the fact that processors often have multiple cores by implementing multiprocess. The computation is divided and given to the multiple cores thus decreasing computation time by better using the machine capacity as is shown with the following graph :
